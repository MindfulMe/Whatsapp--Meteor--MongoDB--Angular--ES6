# Build
### Windows
1) Launch the command line (cmd)
2) Navigate to the folder which contains your source code, project files (through the cmd)
3) Type in cmd "meteor" 
4) Access the server via you browser, you will get the url from the command line (localhost:3000)
### Linux, MacOS
The process is pretty same as for Windows
